- "Programming wisdom for today: 'Code is read more often than it is written. Therefore, write code that is easy to read and understand.'" 

This quote emphasizes the importance of writing clean, well-structured, and easily understandable code. It's not just about writing code that works, but also about making sure that other developers can easily read and understand your code in the future. This is especially important in collaborative projects or when working on large codebases where multiple developers may need to make changes or additions to the code over time.
