- "Programming wisdom for today: 'Code is read more often than it is written. Therefore, write code that is easy to read and understand.'" 

This quote emphasizes the importance of writing clean, well-structured, and easily understandable code. It's not just about writing code that works, but also about making sure that other developers can easily read and understand your code in the future. This is especially important in collaborative projects or when working on large codebases where multiple developers may need to make changes or additions to the code over time.

- "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Donald Knuth. 

This quote reminds us that optimizing code too early in the development process can lead to unnecessary complexity and wasted time. It's often better to write clear, simple code first and optimize only when necessary, based on performance measurements.

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors. First, identify the most important tasks and focus on them first. By prioritizing your work, you can ensure that you are making progress on the right things.

Second, planning ahead is crucial. Think about the bigger picture and what you need to accomplish in the long run. Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks that can be completed one at a time. Creating a roadmap for your code will make it easier to track your progress and ensure you don't get lost in details.
